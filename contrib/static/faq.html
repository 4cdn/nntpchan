      <div>Question: What is nntpchan?</div>
      <div>nntpchan is a federated imageboard that spans across several networks including tor, i2p and anonet. There are no central servers so that as long as 1 server is left the forum will continue to function</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>Question: How is this different from *chan? </div>
      <div>nntpchan is by design invulnerable to global censorship. All moderation is local to each server.</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>Question: How does moderation work then? </div>
      <div>moderation is done with our special tripcodes (ed25519-sha512 signed posts). Anyone can give moderation suggestions, but that doesn't mean anyone will accept them. Those who trust the actions of a moderator can have their frontend whitelist the moderation actions and have them performed without oversight by another moderator</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>Question: How can I remove content from nntpchan completely? </div>
      <div>‾\(._.)/‾ I don't know. You probably can't unless every server agrees to remove the content, even then, nothing prevents someone from reposting it. You can't delete what you post on the internet, it doesn't work that way.</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>Question: Do you allow XYZ content? </div>
      <div>If it violates USA Law or causes problems with my host, no. Otherwise, yes. <b>All posts on this site are the responsibility of the individual poster and not the administration of this server</b></div>
